## Description
The Digital Notebook is a note-taking app allowing users to save notes to a database. Utilization of Express.js enables the app to access note data from a JSON database file. This allows user's data to persist beyond ended sessions in the browser.

Future development for this app could include the implementation of categories/folders for notes to allow users organization of notes.

> [Clone the repository](https://github.com/eepitsporsche/digital_notebook) to your machine to operate the application via VS Code.

## Installation
Access the Digital Notebook via this [Heroku](https://digital-notebook-b0f47115d953.herokuapp.com/) link.

## Usage
Users can enter the note-taking interface by clicking the "Get Started" button on the homepage. Users may enter respective information in the "Note Title" and "Note Text" fields and click the "Save Note" button to store the note in the app.

If a user determines the data they are entering is in error, they may use the "Clear Form" button to erase unsaved data in the form.

Text entered in the "Note Title" field will appear in the left column on the page, wherein the user may click the item to regenerate the associated note data.

Saved notes can be deleted from the app by clicking the trash icon to the right of the note to be removed.
