## Description
The Digital Notebook is a note-taking app allowing users to save notes to a database. Express.js utilization enables the app to access note data from a JSON database file. This allows user's data to persist beyond ended sessions in the browser.

Future development for this app could include the implementation of categories/folders for notes to allow users organization of notes.
